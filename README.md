# Introduction
This guided project is part of my backend-course on boot.dev. It's about building a Pokedex in a command-line REPL.

## Learning Goals
- Practice making HTTP requests in TypeScript
- Learn how to build a CLI tool that makes interacting with a back-end server easier
- Get hands-on practice with local Typescript development and tooling
- Learn about caching and how to use it to improve performance

## Ideas for Extending the Project

- Implement the repl Node module
- Simulate battles between pokemon
- Add more unit tests
- Refactor your code to organize it better and make it more testable
- Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up
- Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
- Persist a user's Pokedex to disk so they can save progress between sessions
- Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than 
typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
- Random encounters with wild pokemon
- Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), 
which have different chances of catching pokemon
