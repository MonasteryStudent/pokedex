# Introduction
This guided project is part of my backend-course on boot.dev. It's about building a Pokedex in a command-line REPL.

## Learning Goals
- Practice making HTTP requests in TypeScript
- Learn how to build a CLI tool that makes interacting with a back-end server easier
- Get hands-on practice with local Typescript development and tooling
- Learn about caching and how to use it to improve performance
